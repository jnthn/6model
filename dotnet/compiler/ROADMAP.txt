Roadmap for NQP and Rakudo on .Net

This document lays out the near-term and long-term things that need to be
done to get NQP, and later Rakudo, running on .Net. The near-term things are
good guesses. The more distant things are hand-waving. :-)

Last Updated: 21st November 2010

=== Add missing NQP features
We support quite a few bits of NQP so far, but some important things are
still missing. These are in rough priority order. There's no reason the
regex step that follows this can't start before all of these are done; all
the ones it depends on should be done.

* Defaults on optional parameters

* bless, CREATE with arg, BUILDALL, BUILD

* Support PAST::Op with pasttype try

* CATCH and CONTROL

* viviself and vivibase review and updates

* Review and make sure package scoped bits are really working

* Other types of loop

* Advanced loop flow control bits

* Hash iteration


=== Port PAST::Regex compilation
This mostly invovles getting regexes, then grammars to compile and run. This
is mostly a guess at an ordering.

* Stub in basic bits of Capture, Cursor, Match

* pasttype concat, scan, literal and pass (should make /foo/ work)

* pasttype quant

* pasttype alt

* Built-in character classes

* Captures (named and positional)

* Built-in rules

* token/rule/regex declarations work

* Protoregexen

* User-defined character classes

* Variable declarations, if they don't Just Work

* Code blocks in regexes

* Assertions (including lookahead)


=== Pass NQP-RX test suite
This is mostly tying up lose ends that have been missed so far.


=== Bootstrapped NQP-RX implementation on .Net
This step is about getting NQP to be able to compile itself on .Net. The
thing that makes this a little tricky is that in a few places we depend
on Parrot-isms, which will need to be eliminated. The proposed approach
is:

* Get DNST.pm building and us able to load it and make DNST nodes

* Make a DNST to IL compiler

* Build a test suite for DNST -> IL. Should be able to do it with some
  kind of eval style primitive.

* Get PAST node declarations translated into NQP and building

* Get a version of PAST2DNST.pm to run

* Build some test suite of PAST evaluation to get confidence that the
  PAST2DNST.pm is actually working

* Get Grammar.pm (modulo any needed tweaks) to compile and run

* Get Actions.pm (modulo any needed tweaks) to compile and run

* Tie it all together


=== Serialization contexts supported and fully used by the bootstrap
Once bootstrapped, do the same refactors that should already been in
Parrot's NQP. Note that we'll snapshot the implementation before this
point, as that will be what others will need to port first (e.g. all
porting efforts will probably start with cross-compiling).


=== Rakudo's parser and actions run on .Net
At this stage, we should be able to parse many of the Rakudo spectests.


=== Compiling Rakudo's setting and get a working Rakudo
It'll be buggy, most likely, but this will be a real landmark: when we have
a rakudo.exe that runs on .Net.


=== Rakudo on .NET
Hack hack hack towards spectest success. :-)


=== Go for beer
Mmm. Beer.
